I wanted to write a simple blog with things that I have learned - in general and on that day - for a long time. 

Github pages offers a very easy way to create a page from markdown content, build it via Jekyll in Github actions and publish on Github pages.

I chose the Jeky theme [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) for its simple style even though writing some html is involved.

Perfect ðŸš€
